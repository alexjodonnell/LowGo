# LowGo
Working on a tiny renderer in c++ that uses no external libraries. The goal is to see how low I can go.
The real purpose for a project like this is to get an intuition for how graphics libraries like OpenGL
work under the cover. 

# Shader Programs
The first release was designed to demonstrate some interesting algorithms that draw to shapes to the screen.
At the moment, the project has become a tool that lets you write your own fragment and vertex shader programs. 

I've picked up a good resource for exactly what I'm aiming to do. You can find it here:
