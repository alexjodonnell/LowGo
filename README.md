# LowGo
Working on a tiny renderer in c++ that uses no external libraries. The goal is to see how low I can go

# Uses
Currently the software can draw lines and basic shapes to a TGA formatted image. Can parse .obj files using the Model class to make wacky lofi looking images. I used it to make my current profile picture. Just starting to work on texture and it can read tga diffuse images and set the texture of a poly based on the obj file.
